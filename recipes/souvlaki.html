        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 medium yellow onions, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 medium green bell peppers, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>skewers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and oregano together in a large glass bowl.</li>
            <li>Add pork, onions, and bell peppers, and stir until coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove pork and vegetables from marinade and shake off excess; thread onto skewers. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>
                Cook on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until pork is no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
